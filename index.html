        Exercising regularly, every day if possible, is the single most important 
        thing you can do for your health. In the short term, exercise helps 
        to control appetite, boost mood, and improve sleep. In the long term,
        it reduces the risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, dementia, depression,
        and many cancers.
        
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you were once much more physically active or have never 
        been one to exercise regularly, now is a great time to start an 
        exercise and fitness regimen. Getting and staying in shape is 
        just as important for seniors as it is for younger people.

        <p>Eating a well-balanced diet can help you get the calories and nutrients you need
           to fuel your daily activities, including regular exercise.
           When it comes to eating foods to fuel your exercise performance, it’s not as simple as choosing vegetables over doughnuts. You need to eat the right types of food at the right times of the day.
      </p>
       <p> As you settle into an active lifestyle, you’ll probably 
           discover which foods give you the most energy and which have negative effects. 
           The key is learning to listen to your body and balancing what feels right with what’s good for you.
      </p>
       <p> Follow these tips:

       Aim to make breakfast a part of your routine.
       Choose complex carbohydrates, lean protein sources, healthy fats, and a wide variety of fruits and veggies.
       Stock your fridge and gym bag with healthy workout snacks.
       The right balance of carbohydrates, protein, and other nutrients can help fuel your exercise routine.</p>
